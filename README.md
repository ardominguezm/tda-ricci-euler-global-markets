# Topological and Geometric Analysis of Global Stock Markets during COVID-19 (2017–2022)

---

## Overview

This repository contains the reproducible code used in the study:

> Domínguez-Monterroza A., Jiménez-Martínez A., and  Mateos-Caballero A., *Network Geometry, Topology, and Spectral Analysis in Global Stock Markets: Insights from Ricci Curvature, Euler Characteristic, and Random Matrix Theory*, Plos One, 2025, In review.

The project analyzes 45 global stock indices from 2017 to 2022 using a combined framework of:

- **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**
- **Network Geometry (Ollivier–Ricci curvature)**
- **Euler Characteristic**
- **Random Matrix Theory (RMT)**
- **Sliding-window dynamical analysis**

The codebase is modular, reproducible, and structured as a complete research pipeline suitable for publication, long-term archiving, and reuse.
